                                                <li>The journey of a UPSC aspirant is one of immense dedication, discipline, and countless hours spent writing answers. Yet, one of the most significant hurdles in this solitary marathon has always been the wait for quality, objective, and actionable feedback. The delay, the subjectivity, and the cost of traditional evaluations can create a frustrating gap between your hard work and your actual progress.</li>
                                                <li>This is the problem we are passionate about solving.</li>
